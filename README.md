# About 
Web Storage API is created using HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript. Most contents in the repository was helpfull for demonstration of the project. 


#What it does?	
It stores the Field Values of our simple Form using sessionStorage and Displays the values in the same web page. So we won't lose the data as long as the browser is open. However, if the web browser is closes all the data will be lost. This just a temporrory storage while the browser is open.
